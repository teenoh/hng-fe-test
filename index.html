                        <hr class="divider my-5">


                        <p>For a couple of years, I have been paralyzed. When I sit down to write, nothing comes out. When I
                            start to design, I stare at a blank canvas. My ability to create things does not meet my own
                            ridiculously high standards of quality, so I get stuck in an endless loop of making decent things,
                            throwing them away, and then starting over from scratch. I’ve been floating around in despair,
                            a creativity limbo, which has nearly destroyed me. I stopped working. I became depressed. In
                            a last ditch effort to restart my brain, I left; I bought a one-way plane ticket to Bali with
                            the hope that culture shock would inspire me to make great stuff once again.</p>

                        <p>That was several months ago, and while I now feel more inspired and energized than ever, the paralytic
                            gap between my actual ability to create and my unachievable sense of what constitutes “good enough”
                            remains. I simply cannot make things that are good enough for myself. This problem festers in
                            my thoughts, and it causes me to doubt myself at every turn.</p>
                        <img id="blog-image" class="my-5" src="./assets/images/blog-image.png" alt="">

                        <p>The truth is that perfection is impossible and “good enough” is good enough. Logically, I know this.
                            But as a designer, this task is insurmountably difficult. It feels like defeat. Accepting good
                            enough instead of absolutely amazing is a tacit admission that I am not good enough to create
                            things that meet the same level of quality that I demand from others when I evaluate creative
                            work. My taste exceeds my own ability.

                        </p>
                        <p>It’s interesting that the source of my internal battle lies buried in something as innocuous as “taste”.
                            For most people, taste is just the basis of opinion. It describes the point at which something
                            flips from being “not good enough” to “ok, decent”. But for creative people, it’s something different.
                            Taste is everything. It is what drives us. It is the definition of success, the ceiling of what
                            is possible, and the source of everlasting internal frustration. Being creative is a battle fought
                            over the slow conversion of a mere idea into something tangible that you think is great. The
                            question is: When do you stop the conversion process?
